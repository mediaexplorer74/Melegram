My fast & dirty R.E. of Melegram7 app and making UWP app for Windows 10 Mobile... 


## Status
RC. The correction of the authorization verification logic has been applied and now the application must correctly check for the token at startup and go to the welcome page (WelcomePage) if it is missing.


## Functional features
- W10M "Astoria" (build 10240) compatibility (experimental)
- Live Tile Updates with unread messages (experimental)
- Full flow captcha + SMS verify login
- Chats list with image as group icon
- Contacts list with telegram sync
- Settings with various options
- Themes for your melegram personalization
- Chatboxes matches to windows phone 7 style
- More features which I can't list it all due to text limit =)
